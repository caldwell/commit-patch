commit-patch
============

Commit patches to Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Monotone, Subversion, or CVS


Prerequisites
-------------

commit-patch relies on several programs to get the job done:

- [perl](https://www.perl.org)
- [patch](https://www.gnu.org/software/patch/)
- [interdiff](http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/patchutils/)
- cp - Ideally installed on your system already. :-)

and, of course, one of:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [mercurial](https://subversion.apache.org/)
- [darcs](http://darcs.net/)
- [subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
- [cvs](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/)
- [bazaar](https://bazaar.canonical.com/)
- [monotone](https://www.monotone.ca/)

## Installing Prerequisites

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    apt-get install libipc-run-perl patch patchutils

On Fedora:

    yum install perl-IPC-Run patch patchutils

On Mac OS X w/ [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

    brew install patchutils
    cpan -i IPC::Run

commit-patch is known to run on Linux and Mac OS X. It is perl,
so ideally it will run anywhere, but we have never tested in
other environments, most notably Windows. Use at your own risk.

Instructions
------------

## commit-patch

See the man page or perldoc:

    man ./commit-patch.1
    perldoc commit-patch


## commit-patch-buffer.el

commit-patch-buffer.el is an emacs interface to `commit-patch`. It
allows you to just hit `C-c C-c` in any patch buffer to apply and commit
only the changes indicated by the patch, regardless of the changes in
your working directory.

To use commit-patch-buffer with diff mode automatically, add this to
your emacs init file:

    (eval-after-load 'diff-mode
      '(require 'commit-patch-buffer nil 'noerror))

The easy way of working with commit-patch-buffer is to `M-x vc-diff` a
file (or `M-x vc-root-diff` your whole project) then kill, split or edit
the resulting hunks using diff mode's built-in commands and to then hit
`C-c C-c` to commit the patch.
