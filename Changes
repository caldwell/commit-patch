commit-patch (2.3)

  * Added Bazaar (bzr) support.

  * Added amend support (via new --amend flag). It's only supported by git
    and darcs at the moment.

  * It now gets rid of unnecessary spaces before and after commit message.

  * Allowed VISUAL/EDITOR environment variables to have spaces in them.
    (So that 'VISUAL="emacs -nw" commit-partial' works).

  * commit-partial now keeps the last few patch/commit-message files
    around for easy reuse when a commit fails.

  * Patches can now come from stdin.

  * commit-patch-buffer.el loads diff-mode on demand for faster emacs
    startups (Jim Radford <radford@blackbean.org>).

  * commit-patch-buffer.el can commit-patch a file loaded with tramp.

  * Fixed commit-patch-buffer.el so it works with Emacs 23
    (Jonathan Kotta <jpkotta@gmail.com>).

  * commit-patch-buffer.el only displays commit-patch output when there
    was an error (Jonathan Kotta <jpkotta@gmail.com>).
