commit-patch (2.5.1)

  * We now use App::Fatpacker to bundle IPC::Run, removing the dependency
    from the release tarball.

    Kogan <dima@secretsauce.net>).

  * Added Monotone support.

  * Support Subversion version 1.7.

    subdirectory would fail.

commit-patch (2.4)

  * Added --retry option to commit-partial for retrying failed patches.

  * Added auto-detect support to commit-patch-buffer. Pass a prefix arg
    (C--) to make it revert to the old behavior and ask for a patch buffer
    and directory.

commit-patch (2.3)

  * Added Bazaar (bzr) support.

  * Added amend support (via new --amend flag). It's only supported by git
    and darcs at the moment.

  * It now gets rid of unnecessary spaces before and after commit message.

  * Allowed VISUAL/EDITOR environment variables to have spaces in them.
    (So that 'VISUAL="emacs -nw" commit-partial' works).

  * commit-partial now keeps the last few patch/commit-message files
    around for easy reuse when a commit fails.

  * Patches can now come from stdin.

  * commit-patch-buffer.el loads diff-mode on demand for faster emacs
    startups (Jim Radford <radford@blackbean.org>).

  * commit-patch-buffer.el can commit-patch a file loaded with tramp.

  * Fixed commit-patch-buffer.el so it works with Emacs 23
    (Jonathan Kotta <jpkotta@gmail.com>).

  * commit-patch-buffer.el only displays commit-patch output when there
    was an error (Jonathan Kotta <jpkotta@gmail.com>).

  * Added SVN support from Peter Mack & Joel Hillacre <support@emergence.com>.
