commit-patch - commit patches to CVS, Darcs or Mercurial repositories
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES
       commit-patch relies on several programs to get the job done:

          perl      - <http://www.perl.org>
          patch     - <http://www.gnu.org/software/patch/>
          interdiff - <http://cyberelk.net/tim/data/patchutils/>
          cp        - Ideally installed on your system already. :-)
       and, of course, one of:
          darcs     - <http://abridgegame.org/darcs/>
          mercurial - <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/>
          cvs       - <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>

       commit-patch is known to run on Linux and Mac OS X. It is perl,
       so ideally it will run anywhere, but we have never tested in
       other environments, most notably Windows. Use at your own risk.

INSTRUCTIONS
       commit-patch: See the man page or perldoc:
         man ./commit-patch.1
         perldoc commit-patch

       commit-patch-buffer.el is an emacs interface to
       commit-patch. It allows you to just hit C-c C-c in any patch
       buffer to apply and commit only the changes indicated by the
       patch, regardless of the changes in your working directory.

       One method of working with commit-patch-buffer is to just M-x
       vc-diff a file then kill, split or edit the resulting hunks and
       to then hit C-c C-c to commit the patch. The other is to use
       PCL cvs mode to tag many files and then to diff them into a
       buffer which can again be edited and committed.
