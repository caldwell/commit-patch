commit-patch - commit patches to CVS, Darcs or Mercurial repositories
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES
	   commit-patch relies on several programs to get the job done:

          perl      - <http://www.perl.org>
	      patch     - <http://www.gnu.org/software/patch/>
	      interdiff - <http://cyberelk.net/tim/data/patchutils/>
	      cp        - Ideally installed on your system already. :-)
	   and, of course, one of:
	      darcs     - <http://abridgegame.org/darcs/>
	      mercurial - <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/>
	      cvs       - <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>

	   commit-patch is known to run on Linux and Mac OS X. It is perl,
	   so ideally it will run anywhere, but we have never tested in
	   other environments, most notably Windows. Use at your own risk.

INSTRUCTIONS
       See the man page or perldoc:
