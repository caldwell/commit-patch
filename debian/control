Description: utility to commit fine grained patches to source code control repositories
 Normally version control systems don't allow fine grained
 commits. commit-patch allows the user to control exactly what gets
 committed by letting the user supply a patch to be committed rather than
 using the files in the current working directory.
 .
 commit-patch supports Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Subversion, or CVS
 repositories.
 .
 Also included is an Emacs interface to commit-patch. It allows you to just
 hit C-c C-c in any patch buffer to apply and commit only the changes
 indicated by the patch, regardless of the changes in your working
 directory.
